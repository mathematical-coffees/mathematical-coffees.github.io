Abstract
----

The goal of this 2-hour talk is to present mean field game theory (introduced by Lasry and Lions) and its applicability to a wide variety of situations/problems. The theory of (stochastic) optimal control will be recalled along with the associated partial differential equations. The need for mean field
games will then be justified by optimal control problems faced by multiple agents in interactions with one another. The main equations and the main results of the theory will be presented. Applications and numerical recipes will be discussed. Mean field games in discrete structures, such as graphs, will also be discussed in depth.
