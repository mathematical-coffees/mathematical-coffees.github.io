Computational resources
----

- [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/): machine learning in Python, contains implementations of many basic proximal splitting methods.
- [The numerical Tours of Signal Processing](http://www.numerical-tours.com) (in Matlab, Python and Julia) contains a section dedicated to convex optimization, with applications.
- [CVX](http://www.cgal.org/): interface for several conic program for small/medium size linear/quadratic/psd optimization problems. Also in [Python](http://www.cvxpy.org/en/latest/).
- [TFOCS](http://cvxr.com/tfocs/): similar to CVX, but using first order (proximal) splitting scheme instead of interior point methods.
- [SPAMS](http://spams-devel.gforge.inria.fr/): state of the art sparse solver, including homotopy/LARS.
